consider throwing a ball.into the air can you predict the motion of the ball after it leaves your hand sure that's easy the ball will move abroad until it gets to some highest point.then it'll come back down and then in your hand again of course that's what happens and you know this because you have witnessed events like this countless times you've been.serving the physics of everyday phenomena your entire life but suppose we explore question about the physics of atoms like.what does the motion of an electron around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom look like could we answer that question based on our experience with everyday physics.why because the physics that governs the behaviour of systems at such small scales is much different than the physics of the Mack.objects you see around you all the time the everyday world you know when Love behaves according to the laws of classical mechanics.but systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics this quantum world turns out to be a very.change plates and illustration of quantum strangeness is given by a famous thought experiment Schrodinger's cat a physicist who.doesn't particularly like cat puts a cat in a box along with a bomb that has a 50% chance of blowing up after the latest closed.the weary open lid there is no way of knowing whether the bomb exploded or not and there's no way of knowing if the cat is alive.dead in quantum physics we could say that before our observation the cat was in a superposition state it would neither alive nor.dead but rather in a mixture of both possibilities with a 50% chance for each the same sort of thing happens to physical system.quantum scales like an electron orbiting in a Hydrogen atom electron isn't really orbiting at all it's sort of everywhere in space.what's with more of a probability of being at some places than others and it's only after we measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is at.moment a lot like how we didn't know whether the cat was alive or dead until we open the box this brings us to the strange and beautiful phenomenon of.quantum entanglement suppose that instead of one cat in the box we have two cats in two different boxes if we repeat the Schrodinger's cat.with this pair of cats the outcome of the experiment can be one of four possibilities either both cat will be alive or both will be dead or.one will be alive any other dead or vice versa the system of of cat is again in a superposition state with each outcome having a 25.she has rather than 50% but here is the cool thing quantum mechanics tells us it's possible to erase the both cats alive.Bobcat dead outcomes from the superposition state in other words there can be a 2 cats system such that the outcome will always be.one cat alive any other cat dead the technical term for this is that the states of the cats are in tangled but there's something.mind-blowing about quantum entanglement if you prepare the system of two cats in boxes in this in tangled state then move the boxes to Apple.ends of the universe the outcome of the experiment will still always been the same one cat will always come out like any other cat Willow.is end up dead even though which particular cat lives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome how is this.how is at the state of cat on opposite sides of the universe can be in tangled in this way there too far away to communicate with each other in time.so had the two Barnes always conspire such that one goes up any other doesn't you might be thinking this is just some theoretical mum.is there anything can happen in the real world but it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed in real-world lab experiments.two subatomic particles entangled in a superposition state where if one spins one way then the other must spin the other way will do just that.even when there is no way for information to pass from one particle to the other indicating which way is spin to obey the rules of entanglement.is that surprising then that entanglement is at the core of quantum information science a growing field studying how to use the laws of the strange quantum.in our macroscopic world like in quantum cryptography so spies can send secure messages to each other or quantum computing for cracking.retards everyday physics may start to look a bit more like the strange quantum world quantum teleportation may even progress so far that.one day your cat will escape to a safer Galaxy where there are no physicists and no boxes
